            <p>Hello buddies, friends, and pals!</p><br />
            <p>I'm so happy to be bringing you the very first edition of <em>chrixi's weekly roundup</em>, a (probably) weekly collection of things that I want to share with you. Sometimes I just forget to bring things up or send them to people, so this is a space where I'll get to share a bit about my interests, the things I've been reading online, and anything else I feel like telling you people about. This blog is available to view on my site <a href="https://chrixi.neocities.org"><em>chrixi.neocities.org</em></a>, the production of which I have been fully engrossed in for the past few weeks. You probably know that I'm a bit of a Luddite, and I believe the internet has been on a ever-quickening death march since like, 2012. From my point-of-view, the internet was once a place where people felt more inclined to share their personality by making personal websites that sometimes didn't have any purpose but to be a collection of links and thoughts. Even early-stages of social media platforms have that same vibe before companies realize they can sell ad space on their site. This causes a drought of personality coming from the top-down, whereby posting is only a means to farm engagement to sell a product. I am a child of online, but my reliance on social media has caused me to resent the internet and forget about all of the cool things that are available for us to peruse; this space is my way of reconnecting with those parts and sharing a bit of myself in the process.</p>

            <p>Queued this one up pretty nicely above, didn't I? Most people use the term <em>Luddite</em> as a pejorative to describe someone who is against technology like some kind of Amish. But the history of the term reveals a different orientation to technology; one where the Luddites are not against techonology for the sake of it, but are against technology that is leveraged as a means to undermine workers and society in the pursuit of capital. </p>
