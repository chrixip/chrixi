                <p>Hello buddies, friends, and pals!</p><br />
                
                <p>I'm so happy to be bringing you the very first edition of <em>chrixi's weekly roundup</em>, a (probably) weekly collection of things that I want to share with you. Sometimes I just forget to bring things up or send them to people, so this is a space where I'll get to share a bit about my interests, the things I've been reading online, and anything else I feel like telling you people about. This blog is available to view on my site <a href="https://chrixi.neocities.org"><em>chrixi.neocities.org</em></a>, the production of which I have been fully engrossed in for the past few weeks. You probably know that I'm a bit of a Luddite, and I believe the internet has been on a ever-quickening death spiral since like, 2012. From my point-of-view, the internet was once a place where people felt more inclined to share their personality by making personal websites that sometimes didn't have any purpose but to be a collection of links and thoughts. Even early-stages of social media platforms have that same vibe before companies realize they can sell ad space on their site. This causes a drought of personality coming from the top-down, whereby posting is only a means to farm engagement to sell a product. I am a child of online, but my reliance on social media has caused me to resent the internet and forget about all of the cool things that are available for us to peruse; this space is my way of reconnecting with those parts and sharing a bit of myself in the process.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://archive.is/Wkfeo">What the Luddites Really Fought Against</a></h4>
                <span class="note">Richard Conniff for <em>Smithsonian Magazine</em>, Mar 2011</span>
                <br />
                    
                    <p>Queued this one up pretty nicely above, didn't I? Most people use the term <em>Luddite</em> as a pejorative to describe someone who is against technology like some kind of Amish. But the history of the term reveals a different orientation to technology -- one where the Luddites are not against techonology for the sake of it, but are against technology that is leveraged as a means to undermine workers and society in the pursuit of capital. A loosely-tied group of textile mill workers from across England in the early-1800s, the Luddites focused on destroying machines owned by mill owners who were partaking in exploitative working practices in a string of protests for better working condition and wages. These workers were not fearful of machines taking their jobs since the machines had already been in use for quite a long time and were intimately familiar and highly skilled with the technology. In response to these protests the state got involved with deadly force, in one of the many employments of government power to protect capital over workers.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>While this article is outdated I find the recount of the Luddites to be fascinating. I also find it intersting to consider that the author's solution to creating a healthier relationship to technology is to touch grass which, valid! But also, 14 years after this was written, it really isn't possible to disconnect just by turning off your phone and going for a walk. The surveilance state is stronger than ever, which to me is the most concerning thing about where we're at (palantir, if you're reading this I'm just kidding! i love how you are tracking my every move ♥). One thing that rings true from this article is that the enemy isn't as clear-cut as it was in the 1800s. There's really nothing we can actually try to collectively destroy that will accomplish anything. So even though it's annoying, I'm still going to deny cookies, turn down the facial recognition when going through security at the airport, and use Instagram on my Safari app instead of downloading the app. I know that I'm the only person I'm inconveniencing by doing these things (and the TSA workers who have to look at my face), but it gives me an ounce of feeling of control over my digital footprint, which is maybe all we can ask for these days. I'll take whatever crumbs I can get!</p>

                <br />

                    <p>While we're on the subject of textile mills, a new craft was revealed to me this week: passementerie, which is the art of creating tassels, edgings, cords, and other such trimmings for textiles. I found out about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pkdickman/">Paul Dickman's Instgram</a>, who is some guy trying to revive a defunct passementerie mill in Chicago, and shares a ton of mesmerizing videos of the creation of these trimmings. I have never thought too much about the production of these items before, and the history of this craft as a trade is pretty interesting.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://archive.is/YDBDz">The Medical Case for Self-Driving Cars</a></h4>
                <span class="note">Jonathan Slotkin for <em>The New York Times</em>, 2 Dec 2025</span>
                <br />

                    <p>Enjoyed reading this op-ed on the imperatives of making the streets safer. As a walker first, biker second, & driver third, it's impossible to ignore how terrible people are at driving. It's mind-boggling to notice how many people are on their phones at the wheel, and are completely ignorant of the fact that they're driving a two-ton hunk of metal. I would say that I trust Waymos since being a safer driver than a most people is a pretty hurdle, but I am not ready to fully accept autonomous vehicles into my life yet for a few reasons. First is that I'm one of the sickos mentioned in the article that do actually enjoy driving. I get so bored and a little bit sick in the car as a passenger, so driving gives me just enough death-anxiety to stay alert and focused on a task that makes the trip more bearable. Second is that while it is undeniable that self-driving vehicles are safer than human drivers, I don't think the data cited by the author of this opinion piece paints a full picture. It's not clear from the data which percentage of crashes involved human interaction from the operator from the Waymo, nor is it clear to see (or maybe even possible to track) how many crashes caused by Waymos may have been avoided by the interference of the human operators. That's kind of a nit-picky take, and I don't mean to discount the fact that more self-driving cars on the roads makes people safer, and that's the direction we need to move in a society. One other thing that I'm holding out for is that we won't realize the true safety of autonomous vehicles until there's enough of them on the roads to be able to communicate with each other. When there's non-brand-locked communication between autonomous vehicles whereby they can know where every other self-driver is in the area, I think that's when I'll fully buy into this.</p>

                    <p>Gwyneth-hive stand up!</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>I don't know why, but everything she does is so funny to me. The fact that she mentions her Enneagram type <em>twice</em> in this one interview is hilarious to me!! I probably won't even see this movie she's trying to promote, but if there's one thing I learned from reading this interview, it's to never say never.</p>

            <h3>what i'm listening to this week</h3>
            <br />

                <h4>ROSALÍA - LUX</h4>
                <span class="note"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/lux/1848167516">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3SUEJULSGgBDG1j4GQhfYY">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6z1sW_qtyg&list=PLN3HOJ-INNEKAox1k-Q6JFIKFLr1xs4s5">Youtube</a></span>
                <br />

                    <p>Simply amazing. There's so much about this album that I enjoy. The blend of Western European-classical & pop really works, and her voice is of course incredible. I have mixed feelings about what she chooses to reference in her music (she has a propensity to hot-cheeto-walk-the-mile-girl vibes), but I appreciate that this album is rife with reference to sanctified women through history (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx66LWV-CCk&rco=1">Mike Tyson calling a reporter a faggot</a>). Currently my favorite song from this album is track 11, <em>La Yugular</em>, specifically the third verse, where she's singing about how big things fit in small things and small things fill up big things:</p>
                    <br />
                    <blockquote>
                        Yo quepo el mundo, y el mundo cabe en mí <br />
                        Yo quepo el mundo, y el mundo me ocupa a mí <br />
                        Yo quepo en un haiku, y un haiku ocupa un país <br />
                        Un país cabe en una astilla, una astilla ocupa la galaxia entera <br />
                        La galaxia entera cabe en una gota de saliva, una gota de saliva ocupa la Quinta Avenida <br />
                        La Quinta Avenida cabe en un piercing, un piercing ocupa una pirámide <br />
                        Y una pirámide cabe en un vaso de leche, y un vaso de leche ocupa un ejército <br />
                        Y un ejército cabe metido en una pelota de golf, y una pelota de golf ocupa el Titanic <br />
                        El Titanic cabe en un pintalabios, un pintalabios ocupa el cielo <br />
                        El cielo es la espina <br />
                        Una espina ocupa un continente, y un continente no cabe en Él <br />
                        Pero Él cabe en mi pecho, y mi pecho ocupa su amor <br />
                        Y en su amor me quiero perder
                    </blockquote> <br />
                    <p>This verse has been rolling around in my head all week. It's not so much the lyrics themselves that speak to me (like girl why are you singing about a glass of milk?), but rhythmically and sonically this verse is transcendent. The way that she phrases this in <span style="vertical-align: super; font-size:smaller;">12</span>/<span style="vertical-align:sub; font-size:smaller;">8</span> time tickles me pink. And the timpani accompaniment is also perfectly offset from the meter change that just feels so good to listen to. A few thing that make me really like a song is when I really have to think about the rhythms in order to hum along, and when the lyrics are transitively constructed. This song ticks both of those boxes.</p>
