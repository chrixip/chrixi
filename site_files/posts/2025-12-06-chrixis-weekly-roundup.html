                <p>Hello buddies, friends, and pals!</p><br />
                
                <p>I'm so happy to be bringing you the very first edition of <em>chrixi's weekly roundup</em>, a (probably) weekly collection of things that I want to share with you. Sometimes I just forget to bring things up or send them to people, so this is a space where I'll get to share a bit about my interests, the things I've been reading online, and anything else I feel like telling you people about. This blog is available to view on my site <a href="https://chrixi.neocities.org"><em>chrixi.neocities.org</em></a>, the production of which I have been fully engrossed in for the past few weeks. You probably know that I'm a bit of a Luddite, and I believe the internet has been on a ever-quickening death spiral since like, 2012. From my point-of-view, the internet was once a place where people felt more inclined to share their personality by making personal websites that sometimes didn't have any purpose but to be a collection of links and thoughts. Even early-stages of social media platforms have that same vibe before companies realize they can sell ad space on their site. This causes a drought of personality coming from the top-down, whereby posting is only a means to farm engagement to sell a product. I am a child of online, but my reliance on social media has caused me to resent the internet and forget about all of the cool things that are available for us to peruse; this space is my way of reconnecting with those parts and sharing a bit of myself in the process.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://archive.is/Wkfeo">What the Luddites Really Fought Against</a></h4>
                <span class="note">Richard Conniff for <em>Smithsonian Magazine</em>, Mar 2011</span>
                <br />
                    
                    <p>Queued this one up pretty nicely above, didn't I? Most people use the term <em>Luddite</em> as a pejorative to describe someone who is against technology like some kind of Amish. But the history of the term reveals a different orientation to technology -- one where the Luddites are not against techonology for the sake of it, but are against technology that is leveraged as a means to undermine workers and society in the pursuit of capital. A loosely-tied group of textile mill workers from across England in the early-1800s, the Luddites focused on destroying machines owned by mill owners who were partaking in exploitative working practices in a string of protests for better working condition and wages. These workers were not fearful of machines taking their jobs since the machines had already been in use for quite a long time and were intimately familiar and highly skilled with the technology. In response to these protests the state got involved with deadly force, in one of the many employments of government power to protect capital over workers.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>While this article is outdated I find the recount of the Luddites to be fascinating. I also find it intersting to consider that the author's solution to creating a healthier relationship to technology is to touch grass which, valid! But also, 14 years after this was written, it really isn't possible to disconnect just by turning off your phone and going for a walk. The surveilance state is stronger than ever, which to me is the most concerning thing about where we're at (palantir, if you're reading this I'm just kidding! i love how you are tracking my every move ♥). One thing that rings true from this article is that the enemy isn't as clear-cut as it was in the 1800s. There's really nothing we can actually try to collectively destroy that will accomplish anything. So even though it's annoying, I'm still going to deny cookies, turn down the facial recognition when going through security at the airport, and use Instagram on my Safari app instead of downloading the app. I know that I'm the only person I'm inconveniencing by doing these things (and the TSA workers who have to look at my face), but it gives me an ounce of feeling of control over my digital footprint, which is maybe all we can ask for these days. I'll take whatever crumbs I can get!</p>

                <span class="note"><em>Gina-B Silkworks</em></span>
                <br />

                    <p>While we're on the subject of textile mills, a new craft was revealed to me this week: passementerie, which is the art of creating tassels, edgings, cords, and other such trimmings for textiles. I found out about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pkdickman/">Paul Dickman's Instgram</a>, who is some guy trying to revive a defunct passementerie mill in Chicago, and shares a ton of mesmerizing videos of the creation of these trimmings. I have never thought too much about the production of these items before, and the history of this craft as a trade is pretty interesting.</p>

                    <p>I don't know why, but everything she does is so funny to me. The fact that she mentions her Enneagram type <em>twice</em> in this one interview is hilarious to me!! I probably won't even see this movie she's trying to promote, but if there's one thing I learned from reading this interview, it's to never say never.</p>
